    <p>              
      The Scottish Fold is a rare feline breed. It originated when a naturally occuring mutant cat was born in Scotland during the last century, at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire. The cat had forward-folding ears because her ear cartilage wasn't rigid enough to support her ears.
    </p>

    <p> Scottish Folds make great house pets and are very affectionate, smart, and talkative. They thrive as indoor pets and get
    along well with kids and other animalsâ€”but they don't mind being the only pet in the house either and will accept all
    the pampering you can give them. </p>

   <p> What Is the Typical Scottish Fold Temperament? These cats have a very even temperament, meaning they are not abnormally
    active, but they are more energetic than just a lap cat. They are also sociable and friendly and enjoy playing games,
    exploring, and having some quality lap time with their family. </p>
