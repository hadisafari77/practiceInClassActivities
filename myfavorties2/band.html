      Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their limitless passion and genre-bending sensibilities with a series of
    independently released EPs that quickly earned a grassroots following. After hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid signed them
    to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope, the band made their major-label debut with Continued Silence, a 2012 EP featuring the
    double-platinum breakthrough single “It's Time.” With their full-length debut Night Visions arriving later that year,
    Imagine Dragons found themselves on a skyward trajectory that saw the album debut at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling
    more than five million copies worldwide. In addition, Night Visions’ diamond-selling single “Radioactive” hit No. 1 on
    the Billboard Rock chart and won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards. From there, Imagine Dragons went on to
    see their 2015 sophomore album Smoke + Mirrors debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Released in June 2017, their third
    album EVOLVE was nominated for a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album and spawned three No. 1 Alternative radio hits:
    “Believer,” which topped the Alternative radio chart for 12 weeks and also climbed to No. 3 at Top 40 radio; “Thunder,”
    which hit No. 1 at Top 40 and scored a Best Pop Duo/Group Performance Grammy nomination; and “Whatever It Takes,” which
    was Top 5 at Top 40 radio.
